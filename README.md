# Bank Loan Insight Analysis - Power BI Dashboard  

## Overview  
This Power BI portfolio project analyzes bank loan applications to derive insights into loan performance, funding trends, and risk assessment.  

## Project Scope  
The project involves extracting, cleaning, and transforming loan data using SQL, followed by the development of three Power BI dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), loan status, and borrower distribution.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Processing:** Utilized SQL for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.  
- **Dashboard Development:** Designed three Power BI dashboards to monitor loan KPIs, analyze borrower trends, and assess loan distribution.  
- **Insight Generation:** Identified key factors influencing loan approvals, risk assessment, and regional lending patterns.  

## Power BI Dashboards  
1. **KPI Overview:** Provides an overview of loan applications, funded amounts, and the proportion of good vs. bad loans.  
2. **Loan Distribution & Trends:** Visualizes regional lending patterns, loan terms, and borrower demographics.  
3. **Detailed Analysis:** Focuses on loan categories, repayment trends, and interest rate variations.
